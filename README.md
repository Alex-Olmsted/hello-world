# hello-world
My very first repository, yay!

This is my first branch bitches! Seriously, I can't believe I'm githubbing. This is, like, the coolest thing I've pretty much ever done. there's really no going back from this now. How will I live with myself after this? Welcome to the long emotional slope down to never ending sorrow whaaaaaaah...

Now this is just nuts. I'm doing another branch. It's complete bonkers that I would even attempt such a thing. Just who the F do I think I am?!?! Seriously, someone will for sure get hurt if I continue. This has to stop.

Like what's next? COMMITING CHANGES???? I don't even want to think if that shit goes down....
