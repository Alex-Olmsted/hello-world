My very first repository, yay!

This is my first branch bitches! Seriously, I can't believe I'm githubbing. This is, like, the coolest thing I've pretty much ever done. there's really no going back from this now. How will I live with myself after this? Welcome to the long emotional slope down to never ending sorrow whaaaaaaah...
